Just a project to imporve my HTML and CSS and learning basic javascript. Still learning the basics of responsiveness on this project and learning new ways to right clean code. 
Going to be using functions, array's, If else and JS DOM in javascript on this project.
Still very new to javascript so its going to be a lot of trail and error but the goal is just to get use to some basic js and make a big project with js in the next project I do. 

This to do / task list is going to be the first version on it. I will later when I gain more skills will make the same project but it will be a lot better
THis will just be a test and see what I need to imporve and work on and also learn things on the way. 

This project is just a task / to do list. I write down what I am going to do in the next day every night before I go to bed. I write down what I want to finish
and what task I need to do for that day . I also right down how long I want to work on school work or coding for that day. This is something that I want to 
add on this project but I might need to wait due to me not knowing enough of js right now.
